# sextic_lamp
OpenSCAD code for generating snap-together Barth Sextics

## Overview

The main file for this repo is `sextic_lamp.scad` (hopefully this is unsurprising).  Render takes a while, perhaps 20-40 minutes, depending on options and whatnot.

The main `sextic_lamp.scad` uses parameter files, such as `parameters_electronics_tpu.scad`.  I surely used poor form in my code, often using global variables with impunity.  I welcome your contributions should you find this irksome.

## How to print

These models are moderately difficult to print, having a lot of overhand right at the bottom, and thin walls.  Your printed will struggle, and so will you.  Don't give up.  

Both PLA and TPU are suitable for these models, and I've developed parameter sets for different materials.  Your mileage will vary.
